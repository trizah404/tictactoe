# tictactoe
A fun little terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game made with Python. Two players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid, trying to get three in a row before the other does. Itâ€™s a great project for anyone getting started with Python and learning how to work with loops, conditionals, and simple game logic.
